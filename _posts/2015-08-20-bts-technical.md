Here at Dreamscape, we believe technology plays a critical role in how we connect artists and fans, so we are proud to present to you, the new Dreamscape Website. 

For now, its pretty basic, but keep your eye open for changes in the future. Its built with Jekyll, hosted on Github Pages, and uses Cloudflare for SSL.
